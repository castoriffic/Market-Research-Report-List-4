<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impact Turbine</li><li>Counterattack Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Impact turbine and counterattack turbine are two types of hydro turbines used in hydropower plants. Impact turbines work by converting the kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy through the impact of water on turbine blades. On the other hand, counterattack turbines operate by deflecting the flow of water against the blades, causing them to turn and generate electricity. Both types of turbines are efficient in harnessing the power of water to produce renewable energy, contributing to the sustainability of power generation.</p></p>
