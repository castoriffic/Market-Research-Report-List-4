<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems are advanced life support machines that provide cardiac and/or respiratory support to patients with severe heart or lung failure. There are two main types of ECMO systems in the market - VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO provides both cardiac and respiratory support by removing blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and then returning it to an artery. VV ECMO, on the other hand, focuses solely on providing respiratory support by oxygenating blood outside the body and returning it to a vein.</p></p>
