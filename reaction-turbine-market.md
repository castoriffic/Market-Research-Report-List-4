<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reaction Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Flow</li><li>Radial Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reaction turbines are commonly categorized into two types based on the direction of water flow through the turbine: axial flow and radial flow. Axial flow turbines have water flowing parallel to the axis of the turbine shaft, resulting in a more compact design suited for high flow rates and low head applications. Radial flow turbines have water flowing perpendicular to the turbine shaft, making them suitable for low flow rates and high head applications. Both types of turbines play a crucial role in various industries such as hydropower generation and water treatment.</p></p>
