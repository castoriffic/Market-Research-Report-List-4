<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power over Ethernet Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power over Ethernet (PoE) splitters are devices used to split power and data signals from a single Ethernet cable to power devices such as IP cameras, VoIP phones, and access points. There are two main types of PoE splitters: passive and active. Passive splitters do not require external power and simply split the power and data signals, while active splitters require external power to boost the voltage and can support higher power requirements. Both types cater to different market needs based on power requirements and budget constraints.</p></p>
