<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CNC Rotary Surface Grinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CNC rotary surface grinders come in two main types: vertical and horizontal. Vertical CNC grinders have a spindle that is oriented vertically, allowing for precise grinding of cylindrical and round surfaces. Horizontal CNC grinders, on the other hand, have a spindle that is oriented horizontally, making them suitable for grinding flat surfaces. Both types of machines offer high precision and efficiency in surface grinding operations, but are designed for different applications based on the orientation of the spindle.</p></p>
