<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyethersulfone Dialyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Permeability</li><li>Low Permeability</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyethersulfone dialyzers are a type of medical device used in hemodialysis procedures. High permeability dialyzers have larger pore sizes, allowing for faster and more efficient removal of waste and toxins from the blood. In contrast, low permeability dialyzers have smaller pore sizes, which may be better suited for patients with certain conditions requiring more careful control of fluid and solute removal. Both types of dialyzers have their own advantages and are chosen based on individual patient needs and conditions.</p></p>
