<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rail Wheel Axle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Axles</li><li>Forged Axles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rail wheel axle market consists of two main types: rolled axles and forged axles. Rolled axles are manufactured by subjecting a billet of steel to high pressure in order to shape it into an axle, resulting in a product with good strength and durability. On the other hand, forged axles are created by heating a metal billet and shaping it through hammering or pressing, leading to a dense and tough axle. Both types cater to different needs within the rail industry based on their specific characteristics and construction methods.</p></p>
