<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bacterial Endotoxin Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gel Clot Endotoxin Test</li><li>Chromogenic Endotoxin Test</li><li>Turbidimetric Endotoxin Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bacterial Endotoxin Testing Market consists of three main types: Gel Clot Endotoxin Test, Chromogenic Endotoxin Test, and Turbidimetric Endotoxin Test. Gel clot endotoxin test is based on the formation of a gel when endotoxin reacts with Limulus Amebocyte Lysate. Chromogenic endotoxin test involves the enzymatic cleavage of a synthetic chromogenic substrate by endotoxin. Turbidimetric endotoxin test measures changes in turbidity caused by the reaction between endotoxin and a specific reagent. All these tests are crucial for ensuring the safety and quality of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p></p>
