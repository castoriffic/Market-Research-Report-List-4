<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet (UV) Stabilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (HALS)</li><li>UV Absorbers</li><li>Quencher</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers are chemical additives used in various industries to protect materials from degradation caused by UV radiation. The three main types of UV stabilizers are Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS), UV absorbers, and quenchers. HALS work by inhibiting the degradation process initiated by free radicals generated by UV light. UV absorbers absorb the UV radiation and prevent it from reaching the material. Quenchers work by neutralizing the free radicals produced upon UV exposure. There are also other types of UV stabilizers available in the market to provide protection based on specific requirements.</p></p>
