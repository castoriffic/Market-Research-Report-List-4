<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Side Scan Sonars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Multi-beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Side Scan Sonars are available in two main types based on the number of beams they use: Single-beam and Multi-beam systems. Single-beam sonars emit one narrow beam of sound waves, providing a simple but limited view of the underwater environment. Multi-beam sonars, on the other hand, emit multiple beams in a fan shape, allowing for a wider coverage area and more detailed imaging of the seabed. Multi-beam sonars are generally preferred for larger survey areas and more complex underwater mapping tasks.</p></p>
