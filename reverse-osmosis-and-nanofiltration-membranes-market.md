<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reverse Osmosis and Nanofiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Based On NF Technology</li><li>Based On RO Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Nanofiltration (NF) membranes are used in water treatment processes to remove impurities and contaminants. NF membranes are based on a slightly less strict filtering process compared to RO membranes. In terms of NF technology, the market is categorized based on the specific filtration process used. On the other hand, the RO technology market is segmented based on the more stringent filtering process that involves removing even smaller particles and molecules. Both technologies play a crucial role in providing clean and safe drinking water.</p></p>
