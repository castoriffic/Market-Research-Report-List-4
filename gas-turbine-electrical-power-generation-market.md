<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)</li><li>Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas Turbine Electrical Power Generation market consists of two main types: Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT). OCGT plants work by compressing air, adding fuel, and igniting it to generate power directly. On the other hand, CCGT plants utilize waste heat from the gas turbine to produce additional electricity through a steam turbine. CCGT plants are more efficient and cost-effective than OCGT plants, making them a popular choice for power generation projects.</p></p>
