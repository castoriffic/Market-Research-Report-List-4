<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Delivery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flow Delivery Devices</li><li>High Flow Delivery Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen Delivery Devices Market includes two main types: Low Flow Delivery Devices and High Flow Delivery Devices. Low flow devices deliver a variable oxygen flow rate, where the patient inhales a mixture of oxygen and room air. Examples include nasal cannula and simple face masks. High flow devices deliver a fixed oxygen flow rate at a higher flow rate than the patient's peak inspiratory flow. Examples include venturi masks and non-rebreather masks. Both types of devices are essential for providing oxygen therapy to patients with respiratory conditions.</p></p>
