<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroprotective Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase inhibitors</li><li>NMDA receptor antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuroprotective products market includes two main types of drugs: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by increasing levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, which helps improve memory and cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease. NMDA receptor antagonists, on the other hand, work by blocking the action of a neurotransmitter called glutamate, which can prevent nerve cell damage in conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Both types of drugs are important in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></p>
