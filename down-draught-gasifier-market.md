<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Down-draught Gasifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circulating fluidized bed (CFB)</li><li>Bubbling fluidized bed (BFB)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Down-draught gasifiers are typically classified into two main types: circulating fluidized bed (CFB) and bubbling fluidized bed (BFB). In CFB gasification, the fuel is heated and gasified within a circulating flow of inert solid particles, providing efficient heat transfer and increased gasification efficiency. BFB gasifiers, on the other hand, use a simpler design where the fuel is fluidized by air, creating bubbles that promote gasification. Both types have their own advantages and applications, making them popular choices in the gasification market.</p></p>
