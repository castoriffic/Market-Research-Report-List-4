<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Crystals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray Drying</li><li>Freeze Drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coffee crystals market can be broken down into two main types of processing methods: spray drying and freeze drying. Spray drying involves spraying liquid coffee concentrate into hot air, which causes the concentrate to quickly dry and form into small crystals. Freeze drying, on the other hand, involves freezing the coffee concentrate and then slowly removing the ice through sublimation, resulting in larger, more porous crystals. Both methods have their own advantages and are popular choices in the coffee industry.</p></p>
