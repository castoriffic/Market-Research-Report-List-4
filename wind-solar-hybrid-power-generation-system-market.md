<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind-solar Hybrid Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System</li><li>Stand-Alone System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind-solar hybrid power generation systems can be classified into two main market types: On-grid system and Stand-alone system. On-grid systems are connected to the main electricity grid, allowing excess power generated to be sold back to the grid. Stand-alone systems operate independently of the grid, providing power to remote off-grid locations. On-grid systems are more common in urban areas with existing power infrastructure, while stand-alone systems are popular in rural or isolated locations where grid access is limited.</p></p>
