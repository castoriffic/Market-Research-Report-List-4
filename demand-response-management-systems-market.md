<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Demand Response Management Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Demand Response</li><li>Automated Demand Response</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Demand Response Management Systems come in two main types: Conventional Demand Response and Automated Demand Response. Conventional Demand Response requires manual intervention from customers or operators to reduce electricity consumption during peak demand periods. On the other hand, Automated Demand Response relies on technology to automatically adjust energy usage based on signals from the grid. Both systems aim to help balance supply and demand, reduce energy costs, and enhance grid reliability. The market for these systems continues to grow as utilities and grid operators seek more efficient ways to manage energy demand.</p></p>
