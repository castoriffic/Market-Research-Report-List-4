<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torque Limiter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Friction Plate</li><li>Magnetic Particle</li><li>Magnetic Hysteresis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Torque limiters are used to protect machines and equipment from damage caused by torque overload. Three common types of torque limiters are friction plate, magnetic particle, and magnetic hysteresis. Friction plate torque limiters use friction between plates to disengage the drive when overload occurs. Magnetic particle torque limiters use magnetic particles in a fluid to transmit torque, disengaging when overload happens. Magnetic hysteresis torque limiters use magnetic fields to control torque transmission. Each type offers unique advantages and is suitable for different applications.</p></p>
